## Project Description

In this project I used methods of exploratory data analysis, resampling, and classification to see which common classification algorithm most accurately classifies the students as placed or not placed. In this project I used Random Forest, Gradient Descent, and xgboost. I used the students subject scores to predict whether they were placed.
